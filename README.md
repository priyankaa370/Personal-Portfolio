# Personal Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio showcasing projects, skills, and experience in data analysis, web development, and tech innovation. I’ve structured this site to highlight the work that I’m most proud of and to make it easy for visitors — including employers and collaborators — to understand who I am and what I can do.

## About Me

I’m a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in analytics, machine learning, and full-stack development. My journey combines engineering principles with creative problem solving to turn data into insights and ideas into interactive experiences.

I enjoy tackling complex problems through thoughtful code, clear visualizations, and thoughtful UX design.

## Portfolio Highlights

Below are some things you’ll find in this portfolio:

- Interactive data dashboards

- Python and SQL projects
  
- Machine learning models in real-world datasets

Each project includes a link to live demos and code repositories.

## Built With

This portfolio website is built using modern web development technologies, including:

- ReactJS — for building responsive, component-driven user interfaces
